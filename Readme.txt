- These codes are just a sample of how to use the Selenium WebDriver with JUnit extensively

- The codes won't run properly on another machine if tried, since they require a specific application to work with

- The main intention of this repo is for the public to show how to set up Selenium WebDriver, JUnit and other small things

- I suggest you read "Documentation for Selenium.pdf" first and only if you want to see an example, you can open the code.

Peace,
